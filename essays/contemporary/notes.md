# Notes for contemporary essay

## General notes

- If Moore's law will continue, it will be on the basis of
new ideas and innovation because the current methods of
improvement are coming to an end.

### Current knowledge

1. Moore's law describes the increase in computing power over time
2. Moore's law seems to be coming to its end
3. Some other techniques are arising which could allow Moore's law
to persist

### Questions that I have

1. History of Moore's law?
2. Earlier potential endings to Moore's law/could this be a pattern?
3. 3D computing?
4. Analog computing?
5. Future of computing if Moore's law is dead?
6. Future of computing if Moore's law persists?

## Mollick - Establishing Moore's law

- Gordon E. Moore (Cofounded Intel and Fairchild Semiconductor)
first talked about this phenomenon in a 1965 paper. (Cited below)
- "Four main factors are responsible for most of
this increase in chip density: die size, line
dimension, technical cleverness, and technical
innovation. Together, they serve to explain
most of the exponential improvements in transistors
per chip described by Moore’s law."

## G. E. Moore - Cramming more Components onto integrated circuits

- "With unit cost falling as the number of components per circuit
rises, by 1975 economics may dictate squeezing as many as 65 000
components on a single silicon chip." - GE Moore
- i9 13900k Intel processor has as many as 26 billion transistors
- "The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at
a rate of roughly a factor of two per year.  Certainly over the
short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to
increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit
more uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not
remain nearly constant for at least 10 years."

## Theis - The End of Moore's Law

- It's getting much harder to save energy as we make integrated
circuits.
- Size limitations are a big deal:
  - "Further reduction in insulator thickness would have resulted
  in unacceptable (and exponential) increases in gate leakage
  current through direct quantum tunneling."
  - "Further reduction in operating voltage swing would have
  resulted in either unacceptably low channel current in the
  “on” state (unacceptable decreases in switching speed) or
  increased leakage current in the “off” state (unacceptable
  increases in passive power)."
  - Also affecting memory devices (SRAM, DRAM, Flash)
- Magnets?
  - "As a magnet is made smaller, less
  energy is required to switch its polarization. Fur
  thermore, physicists and materials scientists have
  in recent years discovered new, energy-efficient
  switching mechanisms. Researchers are therefore
  beginning to explore and exploit the new physics of
  nanomagnetism in devices for digital logic."
- New computation techniques?
  - Focusing on the instruction set as an abstraction
  independent of the hardware has allowed
  hardware and software designers to work independently,
  promoted backward compatibility of code,
  and delivered many other benefits. However, these
  benefits came at a cost in computational efficiency.
  - "Thus, not too many years from now, a computing
  system could have register files and SRAM
  as fast first-level cache. Second-level cache could
  utilize high-endurance, fast-access STT-MRAM
  or a variant. Slower, nonvolatile, very high-density
  memory further out in the memory hierarchy might
  utilize PCM, RRAM, or CBRAM, monolithically
  integrated with the processor cores."
  - "A typical smartphone
  now contains a dozen or more specialized circuits
  or “accelerators” to relieve the central processing
  units of repetitive time- and energy-consuming
  tasks such as video processing."
  - These changes can present problems to the current
  programming workflow, and continuity/backwards
  compatibility may be lost for some devices, which can
  be a downside to this form of computation improvement.

## Radosavljevic - Taking Moore's Law

- "With RibbonFETs and 3D CMOS, we have a clear path to
extend Moore’s Law beyond 2024. In a 2005 interview in which
he was asked to reflect on what became of his law, Gordon
Moore admitted to being “periodically amazed at how we’re
able to make progress. Several times along the way, I thought
we reached the end of the line, things taper off, and our creative
engineers come up with ways around them.”"
- "We’ve made wafers where the smallest distance between two
sets of stacked devices is only 55 nm. While the device
performance results we achieved are not records in and of
themselves, they do compare well with individual nonstacked control
devices built on the same wafer with the same processing"
- 3D development is still new, but it can be promising.

## S. K. Moore - 3 Paths to 3D Processors

- 3D V-cache has been used in AMD's most recent processors
for increases of up to 15% performance.
- Intel's Ponte Vecchio Supercomputer chip
  - "Using both 2.5D and 3D technologies, Intel
  squeezed 3,100 square millimeters of
  silicon—nearly equal to four Nvidia A100
  GPUs—into a 2,330-mm2 footprint."
  - 2.5D is like taking two 2D circuits and
  then smacking them together.
  - This computer pierced the exaflop barrier:
  a billion billion high-precision floating-point
  calculations per second.
