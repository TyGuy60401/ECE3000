Is Moore's Law Really Dead

%%%%Begin body of paper here

The principle behind Moore's law was first introduced
in 1965, and since then it has driven innovation in the
electrical engineering industry. This principle asserts
that the performance of leading computer processors
doubles roughly every one and a half years and it was 
proposed originally by Gordon E. Moore. In his 1965 paper
he talked about the decreasing space between, size of, and
cost of transistors found on integrated circuits. He
stated, "With unit cost falling as the number of components
per circuit rises, by 1975 economics may dictate squeezing
as many as 65,000 components on a single silicon chip"
\parencite{4785860}. A number in the range of 65,000
may have been a bold claim in 1965, but the recent
flagship processor from Intel -- the core i9 13900k
-- boasts up to 26 billion transistors on a single
chip. This dramatic increase, albeit spanning several
decades, shows that the original claims from Moore have
been able to hold true since its inception. Despite the
constant growth that has been prevalent over many years,
Moore's law has seemed to slow down more and more in 
the recent years. As components get smaller and smaller,
we encounter physical boundaries and roadblocks which 
present many difficulties in the manufacturing processes
of newer and faster chips.

With chips being manufactured in the nanometer scale,
we encounter some new problems that have never been
encountered before. Findings from an article showed
that "Further reduction in insulator thickness would
have resulted in unacceptable (and exponential) increases
in gate leakage current through direct quantum tunneling"
\parencite{7878935}. Direct quantum tunneling of electrons
through oxide thickness is a phenomenon that shows
that even if advances are made in finding processes
to allow the manufacturing of smaller and smaller components,
other physical limitations will likely arise which
can prevent the functionality of ever-smaller components.
Another physical challenge that is presented with
minute components is the difficulty to discern between
activated and deactivated currents. From the same
article we learn that, "Further reduction in operating
voltage swing would have resulted in either unacceptably
low channel current in the “on” state (unacceptable
decreases in switching speed) or increased leakage
current in the “off” state (unacceptable increases
in passive power)" \parencite{7878935}. With these
presented difficulties, in order for a future continuation
of Moore's law, the future advances in manufacturing
technology will have to present unique solutions. Until
this point, the increases in computing power have come
from placing more, smaller transistors on the same size
chip. Due to these difficulties, solutions will have to
come from unique innovations.
