Confronting the end of an epoch should enable a new era of creativity by encouraging computer scientists to invent new biologically inspired paradigms, implemented on emerging architectures, with hybrid circuits and systems that combine the best of scaled silicon CMOS with new devices, physical interactions and materials.","1558-366X","","10.1109/MCSE.2017.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7878940","Moore's law;memory driven;nonvolatile memory;photonic interconnect;accelerator;ASIC;brain inspired;scientific computing","Computers;Nonvolatile memory;Scientific computing;Moore's Law;Random access memory;Accelerators;Technological innovation","computer applications","Moores law;computing;computer scientists;biologically inspired paradigms;hybrid circuits;scaled silicon CMOS","","128","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, the field-effect transistor is approaching some physical limits to further miniaturization, and the associated rising costs and reduced return on investment appear to be slowing the pace of development. Far from signaling an end to progress, this gradual ""end of Moore's law"" will open a new era in information technology as the focus of research and development shifts from miniaturization of long-established technologies to the coordinated introduction of new devices, new integration technologies, and new architectures for computing.","1558-366X","","10.1109/MCSE.2017.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7878935","introductory and survey;emerging technologies;algorithms implemented in hardware;memory technologies;neural nets;scientific computing","Algorithm design and analysis;Field effect transistors;Switching circuits;Computer architecture;Random access memory;Moore's Law;Scientific computing;Memory management","information technology;research and development","Moore's law;information technology;Gordon Moore;semiconductor electronics;field effect transistor;research and development","","437","1","35","IEEE","15 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"3 Paths to 3D Processors","S. K. Moore",NA,"IEEE Spectrum","8 Jun 2022","2022","59","6","24","29","A crop of high-performance processors is showing that the new direction for continuing Moore's Law is all about up. Each processor generation needs to perform better than the last, and at its most basic, that means integrating more logic onto the silicon. But there are two problems. The first is that our ability to shrink transistors and the logic and memory blocks they make up is slowing down. The second is that individual chips have reached their size limits. Photolithography tools can pattern an area no larger than about 850 square millimeters, which is about the size of a modern server GPU. ▣ One answer has been to place two or more pieces of silicon side by side in the same package and stitch them together using millimeters-long, dense interconnects, so they can effectively act as a single unit. This so-called 2.5D scheme, enabled by advanced packaging technology, is already behind several top processors, which are now composed of several functional “chiplets” rather than a single IC. ▣ But to sling truly huge volumes of data around as if it were all on the same chip, you need even shorter and denser connections, and that can be done only by stacking one chip atop another. Connecting two chips face-to-face in a 3D scheme can mean making hundreds or thousands of micrometers-long connections per square millimeter. These short, dense connections let data zip from one piece of silicon to another almost as rapidly and with as little energy as if the two were one chip. ▣ It's taken a lot of innovation to get it to work. Engineers had to figure out how to keep heat from one chip in the stack from killing the other, decide what functions should go where and how they should be manufactured, keep the occasional bad chip from leading to a lot of costly dud systems, and deal with the resulting added complexities of doing all that at once. ▣ Here are three examples that show not just how 3D chip stacking is done but also what it's good for.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2022.9792148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792148","","Semiconductor device modeling;Technological innovation;Three-dimensional displays;Moore's Law;Stacking;Lithography;Packaging","integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;microprocessor chips;photolithography;three-dimensional integrated circuits","shorter denser connections;micrometers-long connections;high-performance processors;Moores Law;memory blocks;individual chips;photolithography tools;server GPU;dense interconnects;advanced packaging technology;single IC;millimeters-long interconnects;3D scheme;3D chip stacking","","2","","0","IEEE","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
